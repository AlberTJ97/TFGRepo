response command go REFUSE commanded COMPLY Making table thus possibilites command response name LEGITIMATE COMPLY true obedience ILLEGITIMATE REFUSE true obedience LEGITIMATE REFUSE disobedience ILLEGITIMATE COMPLY false obedience So see classification obedience come Obedience solely matter compliancerefusal The nature command must also taken account enough consider someone compliance refusal say whether obedient disobedient You also take consideration whether command good bad In example Pope command Catholics worship god Dagon refuse arent disobedient As far Society Saint Pius X go certainly refusing comply certain thing Pope desire But alone insufficient allow one label disobedient You also consider nature Papal desire And rub SSPX say Popes since Vatican II commanding certain bad thing Church The Popes course disagreed So Are another Arian heresy complete weak Popes Or SSPX priest modern Martin Luthers Well way answer examine saying traditional teaching Church The problem Catholics much idea really going issue The religion American Catholics especially defective intellectual depth You never read issue discussed Catholic press country On hand one Italian Catholic magazine I get Days ha interview Superior General Society Saint Pius X Many Catholics decide side Pope There soundness Papacy infallible eventually Pope straighten But hand also unsoundness short term Popes may indeed wrong Catholics nothing help situation obeying theyre wrong In fact situation grave enough sin obeying At least theyre wasting great opportunity failing love Christ heroic way time He need badly Schism let move schism What Schism superset disobedience refusal obey legitimate command All schismatics disobedient But superset doesnt work way around disobeyers schismatics The mere fact SSPX priest dont comply Holy Fathers desire doesnt make schismatics So must added disobedience constitute schism Maybe something else make SSPX priest schismatics You must add rejection right command Look decent reference Catholic theology thats youll find distinguishing criterion schism rejection right command Heres Catholic Encyclopedia say example every disobedience schism order posse character must include besides trangression command superior denial Divine right command CE article Schism Is Society Saint Pius X schismatic The answer clear say Pope bos They pray every day And thats matter far schism go What boil leave aside consideration exact nature objection position legitimate one far Catholic theology obedience schism go They resisting certain Papal policy think clearly contrary traditional teaching Papacy best interest Church In fact someone find situation ha duty resist Now stance Rome Well read Holy Fathers motu proprio Ecclesia Dei find Its definitive document subject A motu proprio specifically Papal act Its product Roman congregation letter Pope ha possibly never even read Its Pope His bos God one else complain In document Holy Father say among thing The episcopal consecration performed Archbishop Lefebvre constituted schismatic act Archbishop Lefebvres problem wa misunderstanding nature Tradtion Both confusing I fail see logic Popes point As far episcopal consecration go I read interesting article translation Italian magazine Si Si No No It get back question jurisdiction If episcopal consecration imply rejection Popes jurisdiction would truly constitute schismatic act justifying excommunication current code canon law But problem according traditional theology Holy Orders episcopal consecration doe confer jurisdiction It confers power Order ability confect Sacraments Jurisdiction must conferred someone else power confer Pope The Society bishop knowing traditional theology quite well take great pain avoid pretence jurisdiction anyone They simply confer Sacraments require bishop The Si Si No No article wa interesting posited reason Pope said ha novel postVatican II idea Holy Orders According idea episcopal consecration doe confer jurisdiction I lent article friend unfortunately cant tell I believe quoted new code canon law support idea The Popes thinking point remains great puzzle Theres way schism according traditional Catholic theology So doe Pope think As far point regarding nature Tradition go passage question The root schismatic act discerned incomplete contradictory notion Tradtion Incomplete doe take sufficiently account living character Tradition Second Vatican Council clearly taught come apostle progress Church help Holy Spirit There growth insight reality word passed This come various way It come contemplation study believer ponder thing heart It come intimate sense spiritual reality experience And come preaching received along right succession espiscopate sure charism truth But especially contradictory notion Tradition opposes universal Magisterium Church possessed Bishop Rome body bishop It impossible remain faithful Tradition breaking ecclesial bond person Apostle Peter Christ entrusted ministry unity His Church Papal motu proprio Ecclesia Dei July It seems Holy Father making two point simplified following Vatican Council II ha happened I Pope The argument either case sufficient prove Archbishop Lefebvre must wrong disagrees This weak say least It would helped clarify thing Pope addressed Archbishop Lefebvres concern detail What John Paul IIs stand social Kingship Christ taught Gregory XVI Pius IX Leo XIII Pius XI Pius XII example Are supposed ignore Popes said subject I dont know future hold power SSPX still talking Rome trying straighten thing Many people would prefer call justified refusal obey justified disobedience even obeying God rather man Calling refusal obey obedience put u sort Alice Wonderland world word mean whatever want mean Similarly schism indicates formal break church If Pope say schism exists seems definition exists It may Pope wrong side break good reason break exist shortly healed But one deny doe fact exist It seems grave danger destroying thing trying reform power papacy What good become reconciled Pope future process destroyed ability use tool church discipline Its one thing hold Pope ha misused power excommunicated someone wrongly Its something else say excommunication take effect schism imagination That mean act church discipline legal tool act whose validity open debate Generally ha liberal Catholics problem Pope While often objected church sanction generally admitted sanction exist You opening door people simply ignoring papal decision claiming truly obeying disobeying communion

comprehending revelation Yet Luther also said regarding baptism But mad reason rush forth Baptism dazzling like work regard worthless Large Catechism Fourth part Baptism To make matter complicated Luther wa sort theologian many people would describe absolutist Ive seen described take prisoner theologian We might conclude given observation Luther wa inconsistent mad And surely least come conclusion But might useful recall Jesus wa also called mad And Peter felt compelled defend apostle charge drunkenness Pentecost So Christians ought careful rejecting Luther others mad Rather imitate Bereans examined Scriptures every day see Paul said wa true Acts The basis confidence Luther Peter Paul many others preached gospel wa reason faith Holy Spirit This faith divorced reason faith guide informs us reason The Spirit enables u know truth proclaim boldly God doe want u preach message I think Jesus might risen dead rather I know redeemer life Job The Christian doe side Pilate saying What

Lords Supper really bread well Lords bodyas sens fact tell u Does prove transubstantiation false I suppose someone could say Paul spoke metaphorically Lords body bread simply way body appears eat But thought found nowhere Scripture So reject Thus primary reason rejecting transubstantiation prove false simply found Scripture side remark Ive told Lutheran doctrine real presence consubstantiation But ha nonLutherans told We tend use word I almost think used professor comparative religion need label compare Catholic Lutheran Reformed teaching Lords Supper But almost every church want call teaching

confused Father Congar writes schism involves refusal accept existence legitimate authority Church example Luthers rejection papacy Father Congar explains refusal accept decision legitimate authority particular instance doe constitute schism disobedience The Catholic Encyclopedia explains Catholic truly schismatic would intend sever Church far lie It add every disobedience schism order posse character must include besides transgression command superior denial divine right commandNot doe Mgr Lefebvre deny divine right Pope command affirms repeatedly recognition Popes authority intention never breaking away Rome The Archbishop made attitude clear JulyAugust issue Days We pray Pope every day Nothing ha changed consecration last June We sedevacantists We recognize John Paul II legitimate Pope Catholic Church We dont even say heretical Pope We say Modernist action favor heresy Intrinsically Schismatic The principal argument used claiming Mgr Lefebvre schism consecration bishop without papal mandate intrinsically schismatic act A bishop carry consecration claimed becomes ipso facto schismatic This true If consecration intrinsically schismatic act would always involved penalty excommunication In Code Canon Law offence wa punished suspension see Canon Code Pope Pius XII raised penalty excommunication response establishment schismatic church China The consecration illicit Chinese bishop differed radically consecration carried Mgr Lefebvre professed intention wa repudiate authority Pope deny ha right govern Church illicitly consecrated Chinese bishop given mandate exercise apostolic mission Neither Archbishop Lefebvre bishop ha consecrated claim power jurisdiction They consecrated solely purpose ensuring survival Society carrying ordination also perform confirmation I wish minimize way gravity step take Mgr Lefebvre The consecration bishop without papal mandate far serious matter ordination priest involves refusal practice primacy jurisdiction belonging divine right Roman Pontiff But Archbishop could argue crisis afflicting Church could grave grave measure needed response It appears taken granted Archbishops critic wa excommunicated offense schism Vatican ha certainly guilty fostering impression There much modicum truth allegation The New Code Canon Law includes section beginning Canon entitled Penalties Specific Offenses De Poenis Singula Dicta The first part deal Offenses Religion Unity Church De Delictis contra Religionem et Ecclesiae Unitatem Canon deal offense schism evidently together apostasy heresy one three fundamental offense unity Church But Archbishop wa excommunicated term canon indeed canon involving offense religion unity church The canon cited excommunication come third section Penalties Specific Offenses entitled Usurpation Ecclesial Functions Offenses Exercise De Munerum Ecclesiasticorum Usurpatione Degue Delictis iniis Exercendis The canon question Canon read A bishop consecrates someone bishop person receives consecration bishop without pontifical mandate incur automatic latae sententiae excommunication reserved Holy See The scandalous attempt smear Archbishop Lefebvre offense schism contrary truth charity A comparable smear civil opposed ecclesiastical law would certainly justify legal action libel involving massive damage An accurate parallel would state man convicted manslaughter convicted first degree murder I must stress I written dubious opinion layman unversed intricacy Canon Law Canon lawyer without least shred sympathy Mgr Lefebvre repudiated charge schism made totally untenable Father Patrick Yaldrini Dean Faculty Canon Law Institut Catholique Paris noted July issue Valeurs actuelles I explained Mgr Lefebvre wa excommunicated schism usurpation ecclesiastical function He added consecration bishop constitutes schism conferral apostolic mission upon illicitly consecrated bishop It usurpation power sovereign pontiff prof intention establishing parallel Church Cardinal Rosalio Lara President Pontifical Commission Authentic Interpretation Canon Law commented consecration July issue la Repubblica It would hard The act consecrating bishop without papal mandate schismatic act In fact Code deal offense divided two section One deal offense religion unity Church apostasy schism heresy Consecrating bishop pontifical mandate contrary offense exercise specific ministry For example case consecration carried Vietnamese Archbishop Ngo Dinh Thuc although Archbishop wa excommunicated wa considered committed schismatic act wa intention breach Church It simply unjust ludicrous suggest consecrating bishop without papal mandate Archbishop Lefebvre least intent establishing schismatic church He schismatic never schismatic The Archbishop considers correctly Church undergoing worst crisis since Arian heresy good Church wa necessary consecrate four bishop ensure future Society Canon Law provides situation even one belief future Society could guaranteed without consecration fact Archbishop believed sincerely could mean Canon Law state clearly ha incurred excommunication Furthermore Vatican allows prelate Archbishop Weakland undermine Faith impunity expect Catholics pay least attention sanction great orthodox Archbishop whose entire life ha devoted service Church salvation soul Dr Eric M de Saventhem President International Una Voce Association one best informed layman Church know Archbishop intimately Dr de Saventhem like ha greater desire see reconciliation Mgr Lefebvre Holy See Archbishops lifetime A quotation statement Dr de Saventhem wa published February Remnant merit careful study In retrospect road leading consecration June appears paved grave Roman unfortunately also papal omission Lefebvrist obstinancies And eye informed public hidden attempting present Archbishops act grave disobedience offense Faith It saidtodaythat Mgr Lefebvre ha erroneous concept Tradition If Cardinal Ratzinger could behalf Pope addressed Archbishop following word letter July Your ardent desire safeguard Tradition procuring mean live prosper testifies attachment Faith time Holy Father understands concern share"

wa told circumstance would people fire shot even fired upon They going shoot tear gas armored vehicle would protect would exchange fire In fact know awful lot shot fired cult member federal official There shot coming back government side I asked number question The first question I asked We waited seven week The reason I wa given following Number one wa limit long federal authority could maintain limited resource quality intensity coverage expert They might needed part country Number two people reviewed never seen case quite like one convinced progress made recently progress wa going made normal mean getting Koresh cult member come Number three danger something others wa likely increase decrease passage time And number four reason believe child still inside compound abused significantly well forced live unsanitary unsafe condition So reason wanted move time The second question I asked Attorney General whether given consideration thing could go wrong evaluated might happen wa good She said FBI personnel scene working convinced chance bad thing happening would increase passage time The third question I asked wa ha military consulted As soon initial tragedy came light Waco thats first thing I asked done wa obvious wa typical law enforcement situation Military people brought helped analyze situation problem presented And I asked military consulted The Attorney General said basic agreement wa one minor tactical difference opinion FBI military something side thought wa overwhelming significance Having asked question gotten answer I said thought wa right thing proceed I would support And I stand today Q Mr President THE PRESIDENT Wait Go ahead Q Can address widespread perception reported widely television radio newspaper trying somehow distance disaster THE PRESIDENT No Im bewildered The reason I made public statement yesterday let say reason I made public statement yesterday I nothing add wa said I literally know rather late day whether anybody wa still alive actually seen taken hospital taken custody It wa purely simply question waiting event unfold There wa I I cant account people speculated one way I talked Attorney General day action took place I talked yesterday I called late last night appeared Larry King Show I talked morning A President possible President distance thing happen federal government control I say however I wa frankly surprised would mild word say anyone would suggest Attorney General resign religious fanatic murdered Applause I regret happened possible life control behavior others every circumstance These people killed four federal official line duty They heavily armed They fired federal official yesterday repeatedly never fired back We everything could avoid loss life They made decision immolate And I regret terribly I feel awful child But end last comment I Janet Reno I talked Sunday I said I want tell believe believe believe move rather wait And said child They evidence child still abused theyre increasingly unsafe condition dont think get easier time passage time I take word So I think thing stand Q Can assume dont think wa mishandled view outcome didnt run patience And would really decide way THE PRESIDENT No well I think assume exactly I announced today This FBI ha done lot thing right country long period time This FBI found people bombed World Trade Center licketysplit record time We want inquiry analyze step along way Is something else known Is question asked Is question I asked Can I say sure one could done nothing else make outcome come different I dont know Thats I want inquiry thats I would like make sure independent law enforcement people political people totally nonpolitical outside expert bring bear best evidence There unfortunately rise sort fanaticism across world And may confront And I want know whether anything particularly child involved But I think important recognize wrongdoer case people killed others killed Q Mr President option presented resolving situation point February yesterday THE PRESIDENT Well yes I got regular report along way There lot option pursued If go back covered well The FBI good job I mean FBI authority pursued number option along way lot early seemed working Some child got people left There wa one point seemed line communication opening Koresh authority And would say thing thing began spin downward Whether term happened yesterday conversation I Attorney General involve option except whether take time present strategy pursuing said wanted thought wa best way get people compound quickly could kill Thats thought Q Did government know child gas mask Q congressional hearing situation agreement THE PRESIDENT Thats Congress They whatever want But I think important Treasury Justice Departments launch investigation bring outside expert And I said statement congressional committee want look fully cooperate There nothing hide This wa probably wellcovered operation kind history country"

essentially reasoned three step Despite many historical social demographic similarity Vancouver ha markedly lower homicide rate stricter gun regulation make gun le available The second step reasoning

proverbial urban myth wa inflated one pugilistic talkshow pundit Given shock value finding conclusion New England Journal Medicine NEJM study remarkably understated The advisability keeping firearm home protection must questioned Responsible people indeed question risk benefit bringing firearm home But need know What exactly risk benefit The NEJM testimony neither whole truth benefit nothing truth risk Further motor vehicle want know What control risk benefit And risk cancer heart disease auto accident How minimize risk Like raw highway death toll NEJM stat helpful The NEJM finding

friendly drug dealer neighborhood gang member equated friend The implication offending gun target kill beloved family member dear friend innocent child Deaths may equally tragic character circumstance

similar Title Mississippi Code defines Militia ablebodied citizen state age seventeen sixty two year The Militia divided class The National Guard Mississippi State Guard unorganized Militia The National Guard strange sort fish Constitutional perspective It try State Militia Federal Reserve The discussion paraconstitutional arrangement quite interesting somewhat beyond scope discussion Suffice date National Guard ha ceased Constitutional standing anything Federal reserve force Mississippi States maintains purely State organized Militia In Mississippi called The State Guard In States may called something else The State Guard exists cadre training corp made mostly experienced officer senior NCOs serve volunteer without compensation We drill monthly basis company battalion level

politely refused request one way another Look subject delicate If I comment I implicitly admitting true If I mention specific case even hint I might guilty making public something may legally published The State Israel ha never officially admitted many year prison Israeli citizen sentenced long prison term without either fact arrest crime accused ever made public More precisely A court ordered publication ban wa placed fact arrest later imprisonment In Israel citizen imprisoned without u citizen country knowing anything Not knowing anything fact one person another tried thrown prison security offense complete secrecy In distant past example day Lavon YA affair heard third man prison But many year passed since existed today longer found even South American country former Communist country But appears still possible Israel The Chair Knesset Committee Law Constitution Justice MK David Zucker sent letter subject early week Prime Minister Minister Justice Cabinet Legal Advisor Maariv ha obtained content letter During past several year number Israeli citizen imprisoned various period security offense In case legal publication ban wa imposed specific crime prisoner convicted even mere fact imprisonment In case legally convicted prisoner spend term prison without public awareness either imprisonment prisoner asserts MK Zucker On hand Zucker agrees letter There absolutely question possible case imperative publication ban imposed specific security offense course trial But even case Court must weigh carefully deliberately circumstance trial held public However one must ask whether imposition publication ban mere fact person arrest name person sentenced prison justified appropriate State Israel The principle public trial right public know consistent disappearance person public sight descent abyss prison Zucker thus decided turn Prime Minister Minister Justice Cabinet Legal Advisor request consider question The State Israel strong enough withstand cost incurred abiding principle public punishment The State Israel allowed prisoner whose detention cause kept secret wrote Zucker The legal counsel Civil Rights Union Attorney Mordechai Shiffman said We Civil Rights Union know case security prisoner Citizens Israel imprisoned whose imprisonment made public This situation actually exists definitely unhealthy Just like censorship unhealthy matter The Union aware say Shiffman case notification suspect arrest family member lawyer withheld I speaking several day I know also case detainee wa allowed meet attorney sometimes whole first month arrest That done great secrecy The suspect family lawyer even journalist challenge publication ban court But case family member interested publicity The journalist know nothing arrest almost everyone happy Attorney Yossi Arnon official Bar claim given law exist Israel today situation arrest person security offense kept secret definitely possible Nothing easier The court order publication ban thats Someone ha committed security offense spend long year prison without u knowing anything Do find situation acceptable Attorney Arnon Definitely We live democratic country state affair impermissible I well aware publication damaging standpoint security total nonpublication silence unacceptable Consider trial Mordechai Vanunu least case know wa charged aggravated espionage sentenced year prison The trial wa held behind closed door nobody knew detail except authorized It somehow possible understand though accept reason I noted least aware imprisonment Why matter actually serious Cant trust discretion court Attorney Arnon The judge choice trust presentation made The judge tool investigate This give government enormous power power misuse And really security issue Attorney Arnon I man legal system security expert Democracy stand opposition security I believe possible publicize matter arrest charge without entering detail We already seen law concerning publication ban misused case Rachel Heller murder A suspect murder wa held many month without matter made public Attorney Shiffman hand belief state security legitimate reason prohibiting publication suspect arrest convicted criminal imprisonment A healthy situation Definitely But I aware fact mere publication may harmful state security A different opinion expressed attorney Uri Shtendal former advisor Arab affair Prime Ministers Levi Eshkol Golda Meir Clearly speaking isolated special case Such situation contrast principle judicial proceeding must held public No doubt contradicts principle freedom expression Definitely also principle individual freedom also harmed prohibition publication Nevertheless add Shtendal legislator allowed possibility ban accommodate special case damage possible consequence publication greater may follow abridgment principle Ive mentioned The authority decide matter publication doe rest Prime Minister security service court may rest assured authorize publication ban ha

allthe way theyve multiplied theyre making hard u live Things fine get rid No problem Turks help say ask theyll rid Armenia Armenians half hour Well thats way wa I never thought course would spill bloody tragedy couldnt imagine Here weve living Soviet government year one even considered idea possible But I forming opinion presence authoritative people I would often ask Where leading people really see kind situation emerging The Russians fleeing Sumgait left Why one dealing whats going And happened became clear everything arranged someone else make First Secretary City Party Committee

ha organized Program Study Ottoman Turkish Jewry He affiliated G E von Grunebaum Center Near Eastern Studies Editor How come write two book Turkey European Turkish Jews Shaw Basically Im Ottoman historian Im also Jewish Ive spent twentyfive year studying Ottoman history time went along whenever I found material Ottoman Jews I collected But I never anything couple year ago I suddenly realized wa anniversary Jews expelled Spain coming Turkey Then Sephardic Temple Wilshire Avenue invited give series three lecture Ottoman Jewry These lecture greatly appreciated I became motivated undertake research develop book The Jews Ottoman Empire Turkish Republic This book quite different work Jewish historian tend look Jews country viewpoint Jews Jewish community rely mainly Jewish source I view subject Ottoman historian I approach Jews Ottoman Empire largely point view Ottoman society using largely Ottoman source After I finished book sent press I came across additional document relating Turkish Jews World War II In completed book I said Turkey done good deal rescue Jews World War II I actually many detail Then I found batch document Foreign Ministry archive relating action taken Turkish diplomat help Jews Holocaust It wa late add new information book press I decided write second book I conducted research mainly archive Foreign Ministry Ankara Turkish Embassy Consulate Paris The result wa second book Turkey Holocaust detail Turkey helped rescue Jews Nazis How exactly The story take place number year The book present material three part first deal period Holocaust When Nazis came power Germany immediately started dismissing Jews antiNazi Germans university hospital scientific institute like Turkey moment wa beginning process reforming university saw Jews fired position Germany good source new talent help modernize Turkish university Within three month Nazis started dismissing Jews Turkey arranged take many They brought Turkey given appointment professor Turkish university head scientific institute medical personnel hospital About major Jewish professor came Turkey Ernst Reuter German political scientist spent war year teaching political science Turkey After World War II wa mayor Berlin Berlin Airlift Fritz Neimark major German Jewish economist came Turkey helped establish modern school economics Istanbul A man named Reichenbach wa rescued Nazis Turkey spent war year Turkey eventually came UCLA became professor philosophy Other German Jewish emigre engaged cultural activity Turkey One wa Karl Ebert leading theatrical producer Berlin wa expelled Nazis He went Turkey organized Turkish National Theater Turkish National Opera Company Ankara help Paul Hindemuth So first section book cover first phase Jews persecuted Germany rescued Turkey Oddly enough German emigre Turkey seem think badly Germany They regarded Germans Jews join antiNazi activity local Turkish Jewish community I even found letter Nazi representative Turkey praising German Jewish refugee work promoting idea German culture Even though people persecuted Nazis rescued Turks shared Nazis feeling Aryan racial superiority Turks The second part book deal Holocaust began Nazis occupied France In Europe time especially France Turkish Jews They migrated Europe various reason turn century onward Most settled Europe Turkish war independence World War I Greece wa threatening overrun Turkey The Greeks persecuted Jews throughout nineteenth century Jews feared might happen Greeks took Turkey Many Jews fled France Many also abandoned Turkish citizenship became French citizen Suddenly Nazis invaded France started introducing sort antiJewish law The Turkish Jews soon found wa worth much French Jew wa worth lot Turkish Jew How Turkey remained neutral World War II It retained embassy consulate Nazioccupied country finally entered war side Allies end During war therefore Turkey wa position defend citizen antiJewish measure action Turkish diplomat took form second chapter book Turkish diplomat stationed France particular intervened protect Jews Turkish citizenship Nazis For Turkish Jews retained Turkish citizenship wa generally problem If arrested sent concentration camp Turkish diplomat would communicate commander camp official say effect These people Turkish citizen You cant And Turkish Jews would released If business confiscated Turkish diplomat would protest business would restored The Nazis general wanted keep friendship Turkey They hoped able use Turkey gateway invasion Middle East also wanted obtain chromium manganese Turkey In order keep Turkish friendship usually accepted intervention behalf Turkish Jews The Turkish diplomat sometimes went concentration camp secure release Turkish Jews At time even boarded train hauling Turkish Jews Auschwitz extermination succeeded getting train Most foreign Jews sent concentration camp place called Drancy Paris thats intercession Turkish consul took place The greater problem came Turkish Jews abandoned Turkish citizenship become French citizen The consul couldnt declare people Turkish citizen My book includes photograph Jews lining front Turkish consulate either get passport return Turkey get restoration Turkish citizenship This wa bureaucratic matter processing application would take time In meantime wa real emergency Nazis would arrest Jews street almost nothing The Nazis would even arrest radio telephone apartment radio telephone forbidden Jews To take care former Turkish Jews Turkish diplomat invented document called gayri muntazem vatandash irregular fellow citizen The document said effect This person former Turkish citizen ha applied restoration Turkish citizenship In meantime would appreciate would treat Turkish citizen The diplomat wrote document Turkish put seal Since Nazis could read Turkish whole accepted paper certificate citizenship By mean Turkish diplomat able rescue many Jews relinquished Turkish citizenship Actually Nazis two mind Turkish defense Jews On one hand Nazi Foreign Ministry wanted retain friendship Turkey wa favor accepting intervention On hand Himmler Eichmann wanted Jews exterminated At time Himmler Eichmann able prevail Turkish Jews sent Auschwitz Turkish consul could anything Do statistic many Turkish Jews rescued There Turkish Jews Europe world War II living France Most information section book relates situation France I published letter Turkish consul sent Nazi official letter came back reply Generally Nazis said Turkish consul would present document certifying arrested individual Turkish citizen promise send France Nazis would release concentration camp The Turkish consul also organized special train take Turkish Jews Nazioccupied territory back Turkey These train ran regularly The Nazis gave Turkish Jews visa could pas Nazi territory train often held Naziinfluenced government Eastern Europe Croatia Serbia Bulgaria government really didnt want Jews escape As result Turkish consul effort Turkish Jews France saved Another sent Auschwitz died The remaining either escaped across border Spain fled area southern France occupied Italians treated Jews much better Nazis At end however Italy fell war wa end Jews well Incidentally Turkish diplomat Nazioccupied Greece also worked rescue Jews country The second part book deal Turkish diplomat acting rescue Jews Turkish citizenship Turkish origin Nazi persecution Yes aside I might add In intervention behalf Turkish Jews Turks cited treaty Germany stated Turkish citizen German territory would treated German citizen Turkey On basis Turks maintained Nazis could discriminate Turkish citizen Jews The Nazis claimed Vichy government agreed discriminating treating Jews equally Turkey protested saying You dividing citizen according religion Turkish constitution requires citizen treated equally regardless religion Therefore single Turkish Jews American consul Paris contrast accepted Nazi argument told American Jews persecuted Nazis couldnt anything American Jews treated Jews The third part book take place Turkey wa principal center Holocaust activity aimed rescue Eastern European Jews The kwish Agency organization established Jews Palestine help resettle Jews Palestine set office Istanbul leadership Chaim Barlas Other Jewish organization Palestine especially kibbutz also sent representative Istanbul set headquarters These group first tried contact Jews Eastern Europe find wa happening Today know Holocaust time people didnt know wa going They didnt imagine Nazis could thing And first step wa get information Turkish government let use Turkish mail send letter relative friend Eastern Europe The Jewish organization found wa happening received reply Later Nazis began intercept letter Jews received assistance also Vatican nuncio Angelo Roncali served Vatican representative Istanbul later became Pope John XXIII As Vatican representative war used facility Catholic Church supplement Turkish government wa assist Jewish agency contacting Jews Eastern Europe With cooperation Turkish government agency sent hard currency food clothing even railroad steamship ticket Jews Czechoslovakia Bulgaria Romania Hungary They werent able help much Poland Nazis wiped almost Polish Jews Whenever possible rescue agency arranged Jews get Eastern Europe either train called Orient Express route Istanbul boat Black Sea Istanbul Turkey wa eager refugee remain within border war wa blockaded wa suffering terrible shortage food clothing The government therefore facilitated movement nonTurkish Jewish refugee Turkey Palestine either Taurus Express Railroad mountain Syria Palestine small boat across eastern Mediterranean southern Turkey Palestine These effort bitterly opposed Nazis also British want Jewish immigration Palestine feared would hurt relation Arabs The British constantly pressured Turkish government stop traffic send Jews back In case Turkish government yielding British pressure send boat back For example one incident steamship Struma Jewish refugee Romania wa sent back Turkish government result intervention British ambassador When ship wa sunk Soviet submarine lost except one person Nevertheless told Turkish government allowed fewer Eastern European Jews pas Turkish territory move Palestine Second World War The Turkish authority also provided refugee facility money gave permission send money food country Many Jews passed Turkey may still living Israel Yes child But let return moment first group Turkish Jews came Europe They go Palestine stayed Turkey It wa nonTurkish Eastern European Jews passed Turkey en route Palestine Their story interesting And rescued obscurity Many study made Holocaust focus Eastern European Middle Eastern Jews Most scholarship ha centered Western European Jews million massacred Nazis My study deal much smaller number people I tried round picture I hope book persuade scholar undertake investigation history Eastern Jews When come number German Jews also relatively small number Most million slain Polish Jews The rescue Eastern European Jews may seem significant compared total million murdered meant lot saved About threefourths book consists document translation many document They included story well known Not people West unaware courageous action Turkish diplomat even people Turkey know story I felt would fully understand remarkable achievement unless could see document What language used document Most Turkish French Hebrew There great deal material Hebrew organization boat going Palestine passenger I go detail extensively I describe mostly Turkey document Turkish French A document English The Jewish group Istanbul necessarily cooperate one another rescue Jews fact often fought one another They took turn trying get Turkish government deport rival group For example kibbutz group felt Jewish Agency wa run Western European Jews interested helping Western European Jews Finally President Roosevelt sent personal representative Ira Hirschman executive Bloomingdales department store New York City Hirschman managed reconcile difference The document related mission English I also obtained many document Serge Klarsfeld Holocaust historian France mainly worked French Jews His father wa killed Nazis He gave material gathered German archive Turkish Jews I didnt personally consult German archive
