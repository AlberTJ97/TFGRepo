question I post question time occurs Rather attempt summarize posting get discussion It summarizes argument allowing Christian homosexuality since people asking question already know argument The common question dealt herein Christian justify homosexual given Bible say First definition homosexual Many group believe homosexual orientation ie sexual attraction member sex This distinguished actual homosexual sexual activity Homosexuals abstain sex considered group acceptable However lot discussion term homosexual mean someone actually engaging homosexual sex This generally accepted outside liberal group In paper Im going use homosexual meaning person engaging sexual act another sex I havent heard Biblical argument person homosexual orientation remains celebate I think people admit predisposition homosexual This often called homosexual orientation It known whether genetic environmental There evidence suggesting The best evidence Ive seen homosexuality single phenomenon ha number different cause One probably genetic There several group try help people move homosexual heterosexual The bestknown Exodus International The report Ive seen I havent read detailed literature summary minority opinion Presbyterian Churchs infamous report human sexuality suggest program low success rate question real even success But certainly people say converted However issue important sound Those believe homosexuality wrong believe intrinsically wrong defined God The fact hard get homosexual relevant fact hard escape drug addict If wrong wrong It may affect deal people though If difficult change may tend make u willing forgive One general background issue Its common quote figure population homosexual I asked one expert came Heres response Kinsey see source figure percent He defines sexuality behavior orientation ranked person scale Zero completely heterosexual completely heterosexual According Kinsey onethird male adult least one experience orgasm homosexually post

Kinseys study scholarly world seems take kook Ive seen objection Kinseys study enough detail include If someone would like contribute another view Id willing include Most Christians believe homosexuality least genital sex wrong Not however A denomination accept The Metropolitan Community Churches bestknown wa formed specifically accept homosexual However United Church Christ also allows I think couple group may well The Episcopal Church seems accept area others In church congregational government youll find congregation accept even among Southern Baptists though number probably one two congregation But unusual church permit homosexual church leader How carefully enforce another issue I dont doubt homosexual pastor every denomination open others As argument Biblical issue attempt summarize issue The commonly cited reference favoring acceptance homosexuality previous discussion ha John Boswell Christianity Social Tolerance Homosexuality U Chicago Press The argument pretty clear There several explicit law OT eg Leviticus Rom Paul seems pretty negative homosexuality Beyond reference debate Some passage often cited subject probably relevant Eg sin inhabitant Sodom proposed carry wa homosexual rape homosexual activity consenting adult Theres even question whether wa homosexual since entity involved angel It wa particularly horrifying involved guest responsibility towards guest culture wa strong This probably reason Lot offered daughter wa better give daughter allow guest attacked If look concordance reference Sodom elsewhere Bible youll see seem imply homosexuality wa sin Theres Jewish interpretive tradition major sin wa abuse guest At rate debate homosexual rape wrong I discus Leviticus law part set law Christians consider binding So unless NT justification found Lev alone would settle issue The NT reference Pauls letter A number reference Paul list sin word fairly vague Boswell argues word occuring list list ie I Cor I Tim malakos arsenokoitai Unfortunately entirely clear word actually mean malakos basic meaning soft ha variety metaphorical meaning ethical writing Boswell suggests wanton likely equivalent He also report unanimous interpretation Church including Greekspeaking Christians wa passage referred masturbation meaning ha vanished Cent practice ha come le frownedupon He cite reference late edition Catholic Encyclopedia identify masturbation He translates arsenokotai male prostitute giving evidence none church father understood term referring homosexuality general A technical meaning suggested early Latin translation would active mode homosexual male prostitute view Paul intend technically For conservative view I consulted Gordon Fees commentary I Cor He cite evidence malakos often meant effeminate However Boswell warns u Greek culture effeminate necessarily synonymous homosexual though may associated kind homosexual behavior Given Boswell Fee say taken together I suspect term simply definite applies homosexual case isnt general term homosexuality While Fee argues Boswell arsenokotai well end suggesting translation seems essentially The big problem word almost never used Pauls writing first occurence The fact word clearly composed male fk unfortunately doesnt quite tell u meaning since doesnt tell u whether male subject object action Examples compound word formed either way given In theory could refer rapist etc Its dangerous base meaning purely etymology youll conclude goodbye religious expression based God ye However since Boswell Fee NIV seem agree homosexual male prostitute seems good guess Note translation miss strong vulgarity term however something Fee Boswell agree attempt reproduce translation In opinion strongest NT reference homosexuality Romans Boswell point Rom speaks homosexuality something happened people naturally heterosexual result corruption due worshipping false god One could argue simply example homosexual worshipped false god would also fall degradation perhaps become heterosexual However I find argument somewhat forced fact homosexual reader seriously proposed Paul meant However I convinced Rom sufficient create law homosexuality Christians What Paul describing Rom homosexuality among Christians homosexuality appeared among idolater one part whole package wickedness Despite impression left impassioned rhetoric Im sure Paul doe believe pagan completely abandoned heterosexual sex Given description situation I rather assume heterosexual sex would also debased shameless So yes I believe passage indicates negative view homosexuality But fairness shameless nature act reflection general spiritual state people specific feature homosexuality My overall view situation following I think enough evidence confident Paul disapproved homosexuality Rom seems clear While I Cor I Tim unambiguous general condemnation homosexuality seem like wording would come someone approved homosexuality even considered acceptable case On hand none passage contains explicit teaching subject Rom really idolatry It refers homosexuality passing The result situation people interpret passage light general approach Scripture For look Scripture law issue surprising would consider passage NT endorsement OT prohibition For whose approach Bible liberal surprising regard Pauls negative view homosexuality something took Jewish upbringing without serious reexamination light Gospel As reader group know assumption behind approach radically different people tend foam mouth see opposing view described Theres lot I moderator situation A number discussion past centered around sort detailed exegesis text described However fact Im convinced defender homosexuality actually base belief analysis The real issue seems rest question whether Pauls judgement apply modern homosexuality One commonly made claim Paul simply never faced kind question trying deal He encountered homosexuality context people would probably agree wa wrong He never faced experience Christians try act straight fail never faced Christians trying define Christian homosexuality fit general Christian ideal fidelity seeing sexuality mirror relationship God man It unfair take Pauls judgement homosexuality among idolater use make judgement question Another following In Pauls time homosexuality wa associated number thing Christians would find acceptable It wa part temple prostitution Among private citizen often occured adult child free people slave Im position say always reason think The ancient distinguished active passive partner It wa considered disgraceful free adult act passive partner This reason active mode homosexual prostitute would considered disgraceful His customer would people enjoyed passive role This support idea would tend engaged two free adult male least without degree scandal Clearly Christian homosexual would condone sex child slave others position fully responsible partner However Fees commentary I Cor cite example ancient literature homosexual relationship seem involve free adult reasonably symmetrical way Thus consideration paragraph shouldnt pushed far Homosexuality may discredited Jews association surely must case prostitute involve slave child Some people argued AIDS judgement homosexuality Id like point AIDS transmitted promiscuous sex homosexual heterosexual Someone ha homosexual relationship meet Christian criterion marriage risk AIDS Note good reason Pauls general approach doubt would concede homosexuality fully equal alternative apart specific statement homosexuality I believe use Genesis story would lead regard heterosexual marriage God ordained However way Paul deal pastoral question provides warning quick deal issue legally I claim question counsel homosexual Christians entirely theological issue also pastoral one Pauls tendency see issue eating meat celebrating holiday uncompromising principle pastoral issue look carefully good people involved avoid insisting perfection would personally damaging For example Paul clearly believed wa acceptable eat meat wanted u avoid pushing people action personal qualm For another example Paul obviously would preferred see people least circumstance remain unmarried Yet unable certainly would rather see married state might tempted fornication I believe one could take view like even accepting view Paul expressed Rom One may believe homosexuality God intended occured result sin still conclude time live Note creation story work enters human life result sin This doesnt mean Christians stop working saved The question whether believe homosexuality sinful whether believe misfortune broad sense due human sinfulness If youre willing consider latter approach becomes pastoral judgement whether damage caused finding way live trying cure The danger trying cure attempt often fails doe end damage ranging psychological damage suicide well broken marriage attempt living heterosexual fail This going depend upon one assessment inherent nature homosexuality If believe serious wrong may willing run high risk serious damage get rid Clearly generally suggest people live tendency steal drug addiction even though attempt cure condition also difficult However condition intrinsically damaging way obvious homosexuality Many problem associated homosexuality actually problem promiscuity homosexuality This includes AIDS I take granted sort homosexual relationship Christian would consider allowing would equivalent Christian heterosexual relationship In course discussing last decade weve heard lot personal testimony fellow Christians situation Ive also seen summary various research result various effort conversion Aside Presbyterian report mentioned FAQ summarizes reader report question The evidence longterm success changing orientation rare enough par healing miracle The danger advising Christians depend upon change clear When conversion doesnt happen almost always people often left despair feeling excluded Church ha nothing say requirement lifelong celibacy Paul recognized though different context demand practical people I think history clerical celibacy ha strongly reinforced judgement The practical result homosexual end gay sex club rest sordid side homosexuality Maybe homosexuality isnt Gods original ideal I well imagine Paul preferring see people longterm committed Christian relationship promiscuity As work Genesis suggests wasnt part Gods original ideal either I think relationship still vehicle people sharing Gods love Theres issue Biblical interpretation underlying discussion The issue cultural relativism That Paul say something wrong taken eternal statement thing wrong specific situation culture time Conservative Christians generally insist taking prohibition absolute since otherwise Bible becomes subjective stop u considering everything relative When looking issue worth noting one completely reject concept cultural relativism There number judgement New Testament even conservative Christians consider relative The following judgement least clear Bible anything said homosexuality prohibition charging interest occurs time OT NT I mention relatively recently Church consider binding Christians prohibition swearing oath endorsement slavery institution judgement tax collector sinner We regard item binding In case I believe argument essentially one cultural relativism Briefly prohibition interest appropriate specific agrarian society Bible wa trying build market economy people believe American judicial oath characteristic kind oath Jesus wa concerned people believe Paul wa simply telling people live within slavery endorsing institution people believe IRS morally equivalent Roman tax farming The point Im trying make applying Biblical prohibition Cent need look whether Cent action When Christian homosexual say relationship different Greek homosexuality Paul would familiar exactly kind argument made judicial oath tax collector Until fairly recently Christians prohibited taking interest many Christians regarded slavery divinely endorsed Indeed slavery one common metaphor relationship God human Christians often called servant slave God I trying say everything Bible culturally relative Rather Im trying say thing therefore enough say something appears Bible end discussion We need look whether action talking ha moral implication one Bible wa talking If Christians want argue reason think prohibition homosexuality still binding Im willing listen Those claim question doesnt need looked kidding unless part small minority really obey rule listed One thing worry great emotion issue creates When consider weakness Biblical evidence law Leviticus passage Rom whose subject matter really idolatry rather homosexuality couple list whose word ambiguous amount concern raising among Christians seems rather proportion This suggest people reason simply Biblical involved This true side clearly homosexual Christians strongly motivated find way discrediting Biblical argument conservative Christians find Biblical argument But I cant help feeling Bible used side way justifying attitude come source This dangerous situation Christians On side issue I would like note problem I prohomosexual position commonly presented One common argument homosexuality biologically determined Ie God made homosexual I choice I think God made homosexual fine view people already believe ground homosexuality acceptable But I dont see argument acceptability Many people think alcholism largely biological drug addiction may turn well That doesnt mean OK Most u particular thing tend wrong Some people get angry easily Others tend arrogant Others tend attraced woman married someone else Homosexuality view wrong wouldnt different thing If going follow God end one time another work overcome bad habit particular temptation cause u problem None u sit back say God made u way relax As Jesus said take cross daily This concept dying self also appears throughout Pauls letter seems suggest going thing called accept Pauls letter experience Christians throughout history show u sin ingrained u battle lifelong difficult The fact homosexuality difficult fight doesnt necessarily say OK Maybe isnt place die self But Id like make sure think isnt fighting battle somewhere else rejecting concept Christians fight deeply engrained habit sin"

               "content": "I see revulsion bestiality far exceeds distaste homosexuality Certainly I spoke homosexuality way speak bestiality nobody would trouble labelling homophobe Let ask gently judgemental people sexual preference What happened No doubt I free anything I think serious double standard When describe comparison homosexuality bestiality slimey sleazy making implicit judgement bestiality perverted sinful disgusting unnaturalin short thing society thought homosexuality Not people share view You claim know sincere zoophiles doe mean exist They even newsgroup altsexbestiality Are going accuse mere joker I notice deleted main point comment fact Biblical condemnation bestiality occur connection Levitical prohibition homosexuality While New Testament passage arguably taken condemning homosexuality none condemn bestiality One main point seems Christian homosexuality acceptable due lack clear New Testament statement valid argument Christian zoophilia made much acceptable fact New Testament make reference clear unclear subject I quite serious If I going accept homosexuality Biblically acceptable basis argument I going fair apply standard everyone el declared sexual preference well If argument make homosexuality applied sexual preference well Im going apply see come Im trying torpedo serious issue using label ridiculous joke I posted question interpret Biblical guideline Christian sexuality I dont think question irrelevant group called socreligionchristian The Bible discus homosexuality bestiality together context therefore I feel I good precedent I dont know whether make difference record side issue I believe loving one another includes encouraging people defile therefore high importance determine whether God regard certain sexual act defiling I read New Testament God ha joined together heterosexual couple marriage bed undefiled I read Old Testament homosexual intercourse bestiality defile person whether person Law If gay Christians validly put aside Old Testament standard defilement I want know I fairly apply sexual practice defiled person old day I dont think right take bit piece Law try apply Christians today eg bestiality still defile homosexuality doesnt That wa pretty much said earlier right You used different example I think said essentially thing wrong apply certain part Law Christians It wa intent stir emotional reaction I personally dont get upset discussing alternative monogamous heterosexual orientation Im afraid I naively assumed others would similar attitude Please note I never intended equate homosexuality child abuse I merely noted lack clear NT condemnation homosexuality even greater lack NT condemnation even mention bestiality practice number people eg altsexbestiality consider true sexual orientation This excellent question I pray treat mere rhetorical question genuinely seek discover understand answer I recommend begin little introspection much attitude towards zoophilia Why find bestiality repugnant regard slanderous even mention connection alternative sexual orientation Why apply verse love tolerance zoophiles way apply homosexual Is automatically experience subjective feeling revulsion thought A lot people experience thought homosexual intercourse Is regard practice socially unacceptable A lot people regard homosexuality socially unacceptable Do feel violates traditional JudeoChristian standard sexual morality Many people feel homosexuality doe Do feel Bible condemns Many people think Bible say condemn homosexuality doe condemn bestiality Why think comparing bestiality homosexuality insulting homosexuality If honestly answer question come long way towards understanding many people feel way homosexuality feel bestiality Also please note I sense condemning people I merely pointing I read Bible I see certain sexual practice Bible appears condemn eg sex outside marriage When I say I think adultery premarital sex sinful take failing love neighbor When treat bestiality something disgusting unmentionable disobeying repeated order judge condemn others When say Christians guilty sinning condemning judging accusation making guilty offense Or I simply taking note practice Bible brand sinful leaving judgement people God Im sure mean two paragraph If mean Jesus Truth He accepts sinner doe reject I agree If sinner would need Savior Our salvation Christ however doe mean sin irrelevant u whatever want Nor doe Christs grace mean refer sin sin judgemental intolerant I speaking general term specifically homosexuality If Bible call something sin unreasonable Christians call sin As applied Christian homosexuality I think definitive authority Christian sexuality Bible If make list everything Bible say subject homosexual intercourse I think find every verse list negative condemning worst unclear best The progay statement could make list dispute New Testament verse many people interpret condemning homosexual intercourse That gay perspective positive thing say Bibles treatment homosexuality verse fail clearly condemn Thats Jesus declared food clean council Jerusalem declared Gentiles required keep ritual Law nobody ever reclassified homosexual intercourse abomination deserving death accepted Christian practice You verse describing homosexual intercourse abomination defile Jews Law Gentiles Law verse best clear people believe clear condemnation homosexual behavior thats sum total Bible say samesex intercourse I appreciate personal experience desire everything simple cutanddried blackandwhite whatIwant isok thosewhoopposemearewicked However I think Bible make case definitively would like In fact I dont believe say anything positive case Yes I know verse loving one another judging one another thats really issue You know admit still thing sinful Christians since say wrong Christians condemn Therefore issue whether Bible say homosexual intercourse sin Even challenge clarity New Testament verse still left fact thing Bible doe say clearly homosexual intercourse abomination defile law Mark Actually I dont think reaction comparision bestiality based bestialophobia I think regard slimey rhetorical approach connecting homosexuality bestiality Most people accept homosexuality take radical approach Law They regard Lev binding Christians The argument way text separate bestiality homosexuality wearing mixed fabric This doe mean people limit conduct doe mean accept bestiality It simply mean sexual ethic doe come Law particularly Lev clh"

               "content": "case Are sure want say zero verse clearly address issue The story Genesis tell citizen Sodom demanding opportunity know two men Lots guest fact Sodomites became angry Lot offered daughter could seen indicating interested homosexual intercourse Yes wanted wa rape homosexual rape everybody agrees wrong Some Christians believe homosexual aspect desire wa sinful rape aspect desire The passage doe say wa offended God whether wa homosexuality intended rape I believe fair consider possible alternative light related Scriptures I believe believe God wa offended homosexuality rape trying say homosexuality form rape You seems take view sin described Gen fact Sodomites wanted commit rape unfair stigmatize homosexuality associating sin rape I see might reach conclusion started conclusion nothing wrong homosexuality supposed start conclusion thats circular reasoning If God fact opposed homosexual intercourse general probably interpretation He wa least offended Sodomites blatant homosexuality He wa intent commit rape Later I document I believe Old Testament portrays God One despises homosexual intercourse even partner consenting adult The moderator found proposal circular regarded church proper authority determining kind marriage would legitimate thus church refusal recognize perverted marriage wa circular reasoning My question however nothing church ordaining new kind marriage argument wa something straw man In term original question precise definitiontranslation porneia isnt really important unless trying argue Bible doesnt really condemn extramarital sex Im sure moderator wa trying In case I think moderator missed point When Jesus wa asked divorce He replied Have read He created beginning made male female said For cause man shall leave father mother shall cleave wife two shall become one flesh Consequently longer two one flesh What therefore God ha joined together let man separate Mt I read sexual union man male wife female divinelyordained union In word institution heterosexual marriage something ordained established Godnot men church God Men supposed dissolve union Jesus word something created men This circular reasoning reading Gods word I read Bible God ordained union male female I read similar divinelyordained union two male two female Granted uninspired men ordained alternative union isnt Caligula reported married horse union Jesus refers God ha joined together heterosexual union man wife Pardon mentioning Caligula I know thats probably inflammatory I save discussion bestiality part post Please hold passing judgement read section reply Anyway original question wa whether translate porneia way condemns select kind extramarital sex question wa given heterosexual marriage union described Bible divinelyordained given Biblical prohibition sex outside marriage homosexual intercourse sinful Of course I see first need ask whether Bible really condemns sex outside marriage You seem trying argue certain kind extramarital sex sin really wrong Alternatively may definition term porneia rest wa Pauls day would call FAQ ie Law tutor appointed God lead u Christ spent sixteen century drumming head Gods people idea thing like homosexual intercourse abomination deserved punishment death Perhaps Paul didnt go detail porneia c year considered question dealt already Perhaps reason Gods apostle prophet devote great deal time defining distinct New Testament sexuality wa He intend significant change sexuality He already established Law Ill discus Law homosexuality greater detail I wanted point New Testaments failure develop detailed new standard sexuality necessarily evidence God doe care sexual conductespecially year putting people death practicing homosexuality And define obsessively driven mode sexual behavior How determine difference obsessive sexual behavior normal sex drive Is desire sinful sex obsessively driven mode behavior I think see circular reasoning Why defined sinful Because obsessive What make obsessive The fact person driven seek even though sinful Or obsessive desire society condemns Once thats circular Why defined obsessive Because person want even though society condemns Why doe society condemn Because obsessive You seem trying limit Bibles condemnation porneia perverted sex act I dont think really define perverted without falling exactly circularity accuse What Paul condemning declares Fornicatorsshall enter kindgom heaven I think misunderstood I wa trying make argument technical definition porneia I wa raising issue sinfulness extramarital sex lack Scriptural evidence homosexual counterpart divinelyordained union heterosexual couple Please remember said discus bestiality part I glad asked Would agree God condemns homosexual intercourse even among Law Moses would show Gods condemnation homosexual act go beyond ritual law If I show Scripture God punished homosexual behavior people Law Moses would agree Gods definition homosexual intercourse abomination limited ritual law Law Ive private Email discussion Day Adventist subject Sabbath main point Christian sabbathkeeping requirement ha nowhere Scripture doe God command Gentiles rest sabbath doe He ever condemn Gentiles failing rest Sabbath This illustrates difference universal requirement Thou shalt kill requirement merely part temporary Jewsonly Law Moses Sabbath The point trying make think classification homosexual intercourse abomination part temporary Jewsonly Law Moses I hand believe wa labelled God abomination Gentiles well Jews He punished guilty behavior death exile Heres Back Genesis God promise give Abraham land wa possession Amoritekinda hard Amorite dont think But verse clue might unjust sound seems God going postpone takeover quite iniquity Amorite yet complete Remember long wa ritual law What wa iniquity Amorite wa committing complete would justify cast land andor killed Go back look Lev Verses list variety sin including child sacrifice incest homosexuality bestiality Beginning verse God start saying Do defile thing nation I casting For land ha become defiled therefore I visited punishment upon land ha spewed inhabitant For whoever doe abomination person shall cut among people Notice God say Gentile nation ritual Law Moses punished defiled land committing abomination include incest bestiality homosexuality Flip ahead two chapter Lev find abomination listed time God decree death penalty anyone involved thing including specifically man lying another man one lie woman Lv Their bloodguiltiness wa upon meaning Gods eye deserved die done thing According Lev even alien nonJew sojourn among wa refrain practice penalty cut God among people Under circumstance I believe would difficult support claim Old Testament God objected intended rape homosexuality Sodom Since God took trouble specifically list sex two consenting men one reason wiping Canaanite nation homosexual rape mind plain voluntary gay sex Id say God wa neutral subject homosexual behavior even nothing Mosaic Covenant According II Tim Scripture inspired God profitable teaching reproof correction training righteousness thus I believe even though Gentile Christians Law learn studying If certain action defined sin violation Law sin Law example case Sabbathkeeping Where God reveals certain action abomination even Law I conclude Gods objection practice based whether person Law sinfulness act In case homosexuality homosexual intercourse defined God defiling abomination Gentiles well Jews ie Law well Thus I trying say Gentile Christians obligation keep part Law I simply saying God referred homosexuality sin even obligated keep Law If I think appeal exemption Law valid ground legitimizing practice God ha declared bloodguilty abomination defile Jew Gentile
