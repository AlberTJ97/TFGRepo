denominations accept metropolitan community church bestknown form specifically accept homosexuals however unite church christ also allow think couple group may well episcopal church seem accept areas others church congregational government youll find congregations accept even among southern baptists though number probably one two congregations unusual church permit homosexual church leaders carefully enforce another issue dont doubt homosexual pastors every denomination open others arguments biblical issue heres attempt summarize issue commonly cite reference favor acceptance homosexuality previous discussions john boswell christianity social tolerance homosexuality u chicago press argument pretty clear several explicit laws ot eg leviticus rom paul seem pretty negative homosexuality beyond reference debate passages often cite subject probably relevant eg sin inhabitants sodom propose carry homosexual rape homosexual activity consent adults theres even question whether homosexual since entities involve angels particularly horrify involve guests responsibility towards guests culture strong probably reason lot offer daughter better give daughter allow guests attack look concordance reference sodom elsewhere bible youll see seem imply homosexuality sin theres jewish interpretive tradition major sin abuse guests rate theres debate homosexual rape wrong discuss leviticus law part set laws christians consider bind unless nt justification find lev alone would settle issue nt reference pauls letter number reference paul list sin word fairly vague boswell argue word occur list list ie cor tim malakos arsenokoitai unfortunately entirely clear word actually mean malakos basic mean soft variety metaphorical mean ethical write boswell suggest wanton likely equivalent also report unanimous interpretation church include greekspeaking christians passage refer masturbation mean vanish cent practice come less frownedupon cite reference late edition catholic encyclopedia identify masturbation translate arsenokotai male prostitute give evidence none church father understand term refer homosexuality general technical mean suggest early latin translations would active mode homosexual male prostitute view paul intend technically conservative view consult gordon fee commentary cor cite evidence malakos often mean effeminate however boswell warn us greek culture effeminate necessarily synonymous homosexual though may associate kinds homosexual behavior give boswell fee say take together suspect term simply definite apply homosexuals case isnt general term homosexuality fee argue boswell arsenokotai well end suggest translation seem essentially big problem word almost never use pauls write first occurence fact word clearly compose male fk unfortunately doesnt quite tell us mean since doesnt tell us whether male subject object action examples compound word form either way give theory could refer rapists etc dangerous base mean purely etymology youll conclude goodbye religious expression base god ye however since boswell fee niv seem agree homosexual male prostitute seem good guess note translation miss strong vulgarity term however something fee boswell agree attempt reproduce translation opinion strongest nt reference homosexuality romans boswell point rom speak homosexuality something happen people naturally heterosexual result corruption due worship false gods one could argue simply example homosexual worship false gods would also fall degradation perhaps become heterosexual however find argument somewhat force fact homosexual readers seriously propose paul mean however convince rom sufficient create law homosexuality christians paul describe rom homosexuality among christians homosexuality appear among idolaters one part whole package wickedness despite impression leave impassioned rhetoric im sure paul believe pagans completely abandon heterosexual sex give description situation rather assume heterosexual sex would also debase shameless yes believe passage indicate negative view homosexuality fairness shameless nature act reflection general spiritual state people specific feature homosexuality overall view situation follow think enough evidence confident paul disapprove homosexuality rom seem clear cor tim unambiguous general condemnations homosexuality seem like word would come someone approve homosexuality even consider acceptable case hand none passages contain explicit teach subject rom really idolatry refer homosexuality pass result situation people interpret passages light general approach scripture look scripture laws issue surprise would consider passages nt endorsement ot prohibition whose approach bible liberal surprise regard pauls negative
